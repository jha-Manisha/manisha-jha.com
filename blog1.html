          The communication  skills include four main components :
                                   	Listening
                                   	Speaking
                                   	Writing
                                   	Observing
        Basically , communication skills can be categorised as :
          	Verbal communication - method of expressing ourself through words and sounds.
          	Non-Verbal communication - these can be described as conveying a message without using any written or verbal communication.
          	Written communication - these are writing formats , e-mails , instructions , memos , letters , 
            articles , documentation , reports etc. 
           Visual communication - Communication or conveying ideas through sources that can be seen are known as visual 
            communication , body posture , facial expressions , eye-contact etc are some example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intelligence , knowledge and experience are important for getting the job but without a strong communication skills it is 
            a bit difficult. This is because , when we go for an interview then at vert first the interviewer don’t get started 
            with the technical questions , they first communicate with us and are interested to know about our communication skills ,
            before going through the tests and all. A candidate with good communication will never hesitate while facing an 
            interview and without sounding nervous no matter how critical questions he has been asked or how harder the situation is , 
            so he will be able to present what he wants to explain in a proper way . Therefore we must understand 
            that – Communication Skills are essential for the successful future career of a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a survey by the - “National Association Of College And Employers” ,
           communication skills are listed as the most important quality sought in the job candidates. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In-fact , the “Howard University” study says that , words are only 7% of the entire communication and the rest are body language 
          , body posture , visual , tone or sound we pronounce , auditory etc and the what that communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          So , the conclusion is that communication skills is not only about talking in English or in any languages…..Its all 
          about the manner we use while talking , the way we pronounce the words or sentence , the facial expression 
          which we use or the sound tone of our words or sentence , the pitch of our voice , the disciplines like body posture , 
          body language or the way which can be used to influence others.
